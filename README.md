# StyleAI

Repository for the StyleAI Mobile Application.

## App Description

Welcome to StyleAI, an AI-Powered personal stylist at your fingertips! The team has put development on pause. The latest version of the app contains the colour detection feature, which detects the colour of the user's clothing using OpenCV and Scikit-Learn and uses this information to provide colour-suggestions to help the user create colour-coordinated outfits. This app is built for iOS using Flutter, meaning that users can dress confidently wherever they go. Future iterations of the app will have features which consider the user's general location (for weather purposes) and event/occasion to provide more personalized clothing suggestions.
